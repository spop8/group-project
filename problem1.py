#U: The problem is I have to make a piece of code that can reverse a statement, for example hello will be replaced with olleh.
#C: I can use an i for i to loop through each character and I can also use a for loop to help with that. 
#A: def reversestatementinator(str)
  #declare a variable to hold the user input
  # for loop
  #i for i, take the last index of the users input and place it at the front
  #if the user uses a number, give an error message
